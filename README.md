# QR Code Based Attendance Tracking System

QR Code-Based Attendance Tracking System is a digital solution designed to
streamline the process
of attendance monitoring. It leverages Quick Response (QR) codes to efficiently
capture and record
attendance data. Each participant is assigned a unique QR code, which is scanned
upon entry or exit
using a mobile device or scanner. The system then logs the attendance details
automatically,
reducing manual effort and minimizing errors. This method offers improved
accuracy,
real-time data
tracking, and can be integrated into existing management systems, providing a
modern, scalable
solution for attendance tracking in educational institutions, events, or
organizations.
